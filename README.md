# Twilio Call Forwarding and Voicemail System
This project implements a Twilio-powered call forwarding and voicemail system. It allows a customer to call the main number of your company and choose between two options:

Press 1: Forward the call to your personal phone.
Press 2: Leave a voicemail for later listening.
The project includes features such as logging calls in a database, tracking call duration, and displaying an activity feed.
